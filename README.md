## Usage

### Importing a Game

1. **Ribbon Button**: Click the chess crown icon in the left ribbon
2. **Command**: Use `Cmd+Opt+P` (macOS) or `Ctrl+Alt+P` (Windows/Linux) - or assign your own hotkey in Settings
3. **Command Palette**: Run "Chess Trainer: Import PGN"

### In the Import Modal

1. Paste your PGN (Portable Game Notation) into the text area
2. The plugin validates the PGN in real-time
3. Click "Import" when validation shows ✅
4. A success notice will appear and your game note will be created

### Viewing a Game

1. Open the created note in `Chess/games/`
2. The chess board will render automatically
3. Use the controls to navigate:
   - **‹** Previous move
   - **›** Next move
   - **↺** Reset to start
   - **▶/⏸** Play/Pause autoplay
   - **⇅** Flip board orientation

## Keyboard Shortcuts

- Default hotkey: `Cmd+Opt+P` (macOS) / `Ctrl+Alt+P` (Windows/Linux)
- You can customize this in **Settings → Hotkeys** by searching for "Import PGN"

## File Format

Games are saved as markdown notes with:

- **Location**: `Chess/games/`
- **Filename**: `YYYY-MM-DD WhitePlayer(elo)-vs-BlackPlayer(elo) result.md`
- **Frontmatter**: Includes game metadata (players, date, result, ECO, opening, tags)
- **Content**: Original PGN in a `chess-pgn` code block

## Troubleshooting

### Hotkey Not Working

The default hotkey may conflict with other plugins. You can manually assign a hotkey:
1. Go to **Settings → Hotkeys**
2. Search for "Import PGN"
3. Assign your preferred hotkey

### PGN Not Importing

- Check that the PGN is valid (contains headers and moves)
- Ensure the PGN format is correct (PGN standard)
- Check the console for detailed error messages (Open DevTools: `Cmd+Opt+I`)

### Board Not Displaying

- Ensure the plugin is enabled
- Reload Obsidian
- Check the console for errors
